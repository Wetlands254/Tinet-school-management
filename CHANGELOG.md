- Added a complete daily Attendance register with Present / Late / Absent controls and save/print support.
- Added session restoration for Supabase Auth after page refresh when a valid session exists.
- Kept the correct Supabase project and publishable key configured.
- Added safer Performance page behavior when Chart.js is unavailable.
- Preserved the 9-subject class ranking and A4 landscape print design.
- Preserved A4 individual learner reports and PDF support.
- Reworked the interface with bright modern gradients, colourful KPI cards, cleaner tables, responsive layouts and refreshed login styling.
