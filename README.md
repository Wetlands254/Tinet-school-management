## Supabase
This version is preconfigured for the Tinet Supabase project:
- Project: `ymahunaeaqtmofmxbjhw`
- URL: `https://ymahunaeaqtmofmxbjhw.supabase.co`

The browser uses the Supabase **publishable/anon key**. Never replace it with a service-role key.

Run `supabase-schema.sql` once in Supabase SQL Editor, then create staff accounts in **Authentication → Users**. Login uses those Supabase Auth email/password accounts.

## GitHub Pages
Upload the project files to the repository root and enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

After deployment, hard-refresh the site once. The app restores an existing Supabase session when possible.
